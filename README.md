# ws2812-nop-stm32f0
Nop-based bitbanger for 48MHz stm32f0 devices. 
Partially based on [ws2812-nop-samd51](https://github.com/smart-leds-rs/ws2812-nop-samd51).

Because of hal overhead/other stuff, this might not always work and break with
updates, optimizer settings etc..

These timings are for Os and lto.
